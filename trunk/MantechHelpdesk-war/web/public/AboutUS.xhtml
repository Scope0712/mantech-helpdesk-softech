                        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                        <p> <img align="left" class="image-left" alt="" src="../images/hushlady.jpg"/> ManTech International Corporation is comprised of more than 10,000 talented employees working in 49 states and approximately 40 countries around the world in support of our nation’s national security mission. We adhere to the simple, no-nonsense values on which ManTech was founded more than four decades ago, aligning squarely with the mission objectives of our customers. As our customer base continues to expand and diversify, we continue to diversify our workforce and solutions. Half our employees have a military background, and more than 70 percent hold a government security clearance.</p>
                        <p>As a leading provider of innovative technology services and solutions for the nation’s defense, security, space, and intelligence communities, we hold nearly 1,000 active contracts with more than 40 different government agencies, including:</p>

                            <li>All branches of the Armed Forces</li>
                            <li>Departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security</li>
                            <li>Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation</li>

                        <p><img align="right" alt="Collage" src="../images/about_collage_01.jpg"/>We believe ManTech is the most efficient provider of mission-critical services in the federal government marketplace.

                        <h3>Customer-driven</h3>
                        <p>Our primary customer is the U.S. federal government. In today’s increasingly dangerous world, the need for sophisticated intelligence gathering and information sharing activities is greater than ever.

                        <h3>Systems Engineering and Advanced Technology </h3>
                        <p>Our disciplined systems engineering support relies on a proprietary toolset, the ManTech Enterprise Framework, to guide us in integrating the full spectrum of project management, systems engineering and acquisition practices necessary to effectively manage a project or system over its life cycle.</p>
